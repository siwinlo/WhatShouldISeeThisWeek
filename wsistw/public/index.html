      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        Are you overwhelmed by the number of art exhibitions in your city? Would
        you like to randomly choose one to see, thereby getting you out of your
        comfort zone, and taking the onus for choosing a "decent" or "cool" show
        out of your hands entirely? Well, you are in luck!

        the Fuck Should I Go to Eat) and drawing on an external API.
